    Title: Mobius function
    Description: Find the mobius function for all numbers < MAXN
    Complexity: O(n)
    
    Details:
    μ[n] = +1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.
    μ[n] = −1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.
    μ[n] = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.
